Here’s a sample dataset you can use in Excel to practice filtering and sorting. The data set contains a mix of customer information, products, and sales.

### Instructions for Filtering and Sorting:

1. **Sorting:**
   - You can sort the dataset based on the “Age” column to view customers in ascending or descending order of age.
   - You can also sort by “Total Price” to see the highest or lowest sales.

2. **Filtering:**
   - Filter by “Gender” to view only male or female customers.
   - Filter by “City” to view all customers from a specific city (e.g., New York).
   - Filter by “Product” to see all customers who bought a specific item, like "Laptop" or "Smartphone."
   - Use custom filters, like filtering by “Age” greater than 30 or by “Total Price” greater than 1000.
